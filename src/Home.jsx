        <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold">Why Books Matter</h1>
        <p className="text-justify">
          Books have long been cherished as windows to different worlds,
          cultures, and ideas. Reading offers a unique form of escapism,
          allowing you to experience stories that transcend time and space. But
          books aren't just a means of escape – they’re also powerful tools for
          self-reflection, growth, and education. Through carefully crafted
          words, they allow us to connect with characters, explore new
          philosophies, and better understand ourselves. On this page, I’ll be
          highlighting a selection of my favorite books – those that have made a
          lasting impression on me, taught me valuable lessons, or simply
          provided hours of entertainment. From classic literature to
          contemporary fiction, I hope to offer a diverse range of
          recommendations that appeal to all kinds of readers.

        <h2 className="text-4xl font-bold">What Makes a Book Stand Out?</h2>
        <p className="text-justify">
          When curating a list of favorite books, several factors come into
          play. First and foremost is the emotional connection a book fosters.
          Books that evoke strong emotions – whether they make you laugh, cry,
          or feel deeply connected to the characters – are often those that
          remain with you long after you've turned the last page. Additionally,
          the richness of the world-building, the complexity of the plot, and
          the depth of the themes explored can elevate a book to a timeless
          favorite. In my list, you'll find novels that explore universal themes
          such as love, loss, identity, and the pursuit of meaning, all told
          through various genres like fantasy, science fiction, romance, and
          historical fiction.
        </p>
        <h2 className="text-4xl font-bold">What is Manhwa?</h2>
        <p className="text-justify">
          While books are the core of traditional storytelling, manhwa
          introduces a different flavor of narrative experience. Manhwa refers
          to South Korean comics that blend beautiful illustrations with
          gripping plots. Much like Japanese manga or Chinese manhua, manhwa is
          a visually-driven medium that balances art and storytelling. What
          makes manhwa stand out is the distinct style of Korean artistry
          combined with a range of genres that can satisfy any reader, whether
          you're into romance, action, fantasy, or slice-of-life stories. Manhwa
          has exploded in popularity over recent years, thanks to online
          platforms and digital access. It’s no longer niche; it has become a
          global phenomenon with millions of dedicated fans. The combination of
          serialized chapters, character-driven plots, and stunning artwork
          makes it an addictive form of entertainment.
